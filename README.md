# Sentiment Analysis Model Installation Guide

## Step 1: Clone the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CristianPerafan/sentiment-analysisModel-ti2
cd sentiment-analysisModel-ti2
```

## Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Windows)
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
```

## Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Mac/Linux)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 4: Install Jupyter Kernel
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv
```

## Step 5: Launch Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Step 6: Open Jupyter Notebook and Set Kernel
1. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8888/.
2. Navigate to the notebook you want to use (`sentiment-analysis.ipynb`).
3. In the Jupyter Notebook, select "Kernel" from the menu.
4. Choose "Change Kernel" and select the virtual environment you created (`venv`).

## Step 7: Run the Sentiment Analysis Project
Follow the instructions provided in the Jupyter Notebook to build and train the sentiment analysis model using supervised learning with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

Note: Make sure to adapt the commands according to your operating system. The provided commands are for both Windows and Mac/Linux users.
